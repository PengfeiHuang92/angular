download node (https://nodejs.org/en/)

download Angular CLI (npm install -g @angular/cli)

creat a new ng project (ng new hello-world)

go to the application folder and run the command 'ng serve' to start the serve

-----------

intall typescript (pm install -g typescript)

'tsc main.ts' transplite typeScript to javaScript. 

'ng main.js' to run the JavaScript
 
'ng g c class'  creat a new conponent called class from command line.
 
'ng g s class'  creat a new service call class from command line

'ng g p class'  creat a new custom pipe class from command line

'ng g d customDirectives' creat a custom directive from command line

'npm install bootstrap --save' install bootstrap and the save flag adds bootstrap as a dependency into package.json file
go to the style.css and do the import '@import "~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";'
----------

TypeScript

know the different between 'var i' and  'let i'.
var: Declare a global variable
let: Declare a local variable
Should use let instead of var most of time to avoid the logic error.

Declare a variable: (number, boolean, string, any, number[] or  
 by default, 'let a' declare a local variable with any type.
 1. let a: number;   ( declare a local number type variable a )
 2. var a: string;   ( declare a global strig type variable a )
 3. let a: any;	     ( declare a varible with no specific type )
 4. let a: any[] = [1,true,'a'] ( declare a local string with any type )
 5. const a = 0;     ( declare a constant variable a with value 0 )
 6. enum Color {Red = 0, Green = 1, Blue = 2};  
    let background = Color.Red;  //calling a enum 
 7. let message; //message is a any type variable
    let endsWith = (<string>message).endsWith('a'); //by using <string> to tell TypeScript that message is string type
    let endsWith = (message as string).endsWith('a'); //or using message as string

defined a function
 1. let doSomething = function(message){console.log(message);}
 2. let doSomething = (message) => {console.log(message);}  // arrow function

event bubbling
	<element> 		   ^
		<element>	   |
			<element>  |

by using $event.stopPropagation() to prvent event bubbling

Asynchronous Operation:
  The process that excuted our code does not want to block while 
waiting for the result coming back from the server.
--------------------
PascalCase is a naming convention in which the first letter of each word in a compound word is capitalized
Cohesion : things that are related should be part of one unit they should go together.
  example: when declare a class, all the related function should be part of the interface.
